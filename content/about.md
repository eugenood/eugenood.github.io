title: "About Me"
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). I am currently advised by [Prof. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/).

I specialize in **algorithm design**, **machine learning**, and **optimization**, with a focus on applying mathematical modeling and principled algorithmic techniques to solve real-world problems. Currently, my work explores fairness in repeated matching problems.
