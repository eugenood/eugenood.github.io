I enjoy teaching and find it rewarding to help students grow and succeed. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive the *NUS SoC Honor List of Student Tutors* awards for 2020/2021 and 2023/2024, as well as the *NUS SoC Teaching Fellowship* for 2023/2024 and 2025/2026. Below is an overview of my teaching experiences.
